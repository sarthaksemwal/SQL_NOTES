# DDL Notes

## Overview
This document provides an overview of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands in SQL along with examples for each command.

## 1. CREATE
- **Description:** Used to create database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT
  );
  ```

## 2. ALTER
- **Description:** Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Employees
  ADD COLUMN Department VARCHAR(50);
  ```

## 3. DROP
- **Description:** Deletes an existing database object.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Employees;
  ```

## 4. TRUNCATE
- **Description:** Removes all records from a table, but keeps the table structure intact.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
  ```

## 5. RENAME
- **Description:** Renames an existing database object.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Employees
  RENAME TO Staff;
  ```

## 6. COMMENT
- **Description:** Adds comments to the data dictionary.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  COMMENT ON TABLE Employees
  IS 'This table stores information about employees';
  ```

## 7. GRANT
- **Description:** Provides privileges to users.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO HR;
  ```

## 8. REVOKE
- **Description:** Removes privileges from users.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM HR;
  ```

## Usage
These examples demonstrate the usage of DDL commands in SQL for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of a database. These commands are essential for database administrators and developers when working with database schema and objects.

# Folder README

## Overview
This folder contains various assignments related to SQL queries and database management.

## Assignments

### 1. Table Creation
- **Task:** Create a table named `Students` with specific columns.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Students (
      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT,
      Grade VARCHAR(2)
  );
  ```

### 2. Adding Column
- **Task:** Add a column named `City` to the `Students` table.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students
  ADD COLUMN City VARCHAR(50);
  ```

### 3. Table Modification
- **Task:** Modify the `Grade` column in the `Students` table to allow a maximum length of 3 characters.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students
  MODIFY COLUMN Grade VARCHAR(3);
  ```

### 4. Table Deletion
- **Task:** Drop the `Students` table.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Students;
  ```

### 5. Table Renaming
- **Task:** Rename the `Students` table to `Enrolled_Students`.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students
  RENAME TO Enrolled_Students;
  ```

### 6. Column Deletion
- **Task:** Remove the `Age` column from the `Enrolled_Students` table.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Enrolled_Students
  DROP COLUMN Age;
  ```

### 7. Table Commenting
- **Task:** Add a comment to the `Enrolled_Students` table.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  COMMENT ON TABLE Enrolled_Students
  IS 'This table stores information about enrolled students';
  ```

### 8. Privilege Assignment
- **Task:** Grant SELECT and INSERT privileges on the `Enrolled_Students` table to the user `enrollment_officer`.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Enrolled_Students TO enrollment_officer;
  ```

### 9. Privilege Revocation
- **Task:** Revoke INSERT privilege on the `Enrolled_Students` table from the user `enrollment_officer`.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  REVOKE INSERT ON Enrolled_Students FROM enrollment_officer;
  ```

### 10. Index Creation
- **Task:** Create an index named `idx_student_id` on the `StudentID` column of the `Enrolled_Students` table.
- **SQL Code:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_student_id ON Enrolled_Students(StudentID);
  ```

## Usage
These SQL commands can be executed in a database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to perform various data definition tasks.
